## Project Overview

DeliveryTak is a Flutter application for managing deliveries, connecting customers, delivery drivers, and administrators. The application handles order tracking, delivery scheduling, route optimization, payments, and ratings.

## Application Entry Point

### main.dart

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await Firebase.initializeApp();
  await dotenv.load();
```
- Initializes Flutter widgets binding to interact with Flutter's engine
- Initializes Firebase for backend services
- Loads environment variables from .env file

```dart
  Logger.root.level = Level.ALL;
  Logger.root.onRecord.listen((record) {
    debugPrint('${record.level.name}: ${record.time}: ${record.message}');
  });
```
- Configures logging system to record all log levels
- Sets up a listener for log records to print them to the debug console

```dart
  final notificationService = NotificationService(logger);
  await notificationService.initialize();
```
- Instantiates and initializes the notification service for push notifications

```dart
  // Initialize services
  final authService = AuthService(null, logger);
  final driverService = DriverService(null, logger);
  final deliveryService = DeliveryService(firestore: FirebaseFirestore.instance, logger: logger);
  // ... more service initializations
```
- Creates instances of all required services with their dependencies
- Injects Firebase Firestore instance where needed
- Provides logging capability to each service

```dart
  runApp(
    MultiProvider(
      providers: [
        ChangeNotifierProvider<AuthProvider>(
          create: (_) => AuthProvider(authService),
        ),
        // ... more providers
      ],
      child: MaterialApp(
        title: 'DeliveryTak',
        theme: AppTheme.lightTheme,
        darkTheme: AppTheme.darkTheme,
        themeMode: ThemeMode.system,
        initialRoute: AppRoutes.home,
        routes: AppRoutes.routes,
      ),
    ),
```
- Runs the Flutter application with Provider pattern for state management
- Creates and provides all necessary ChangeNotifierProvider instances
- Configures the Material app with themes, routes, and title

## Configuration

### routes.dart

```dart
class AppRoutes {
  static const String home = '/';
  static const String login = '/login';
  // ... more route constants
```
- Defines string constants for all application routes

```dart
  static Map<String, WidgetBuilder> get routes => {
        home: (context) => const HomePage(),
        login: (context) => const LoginPage(),
        // ... more route mappings
```
- Maps route names to their respective widget constructors
- Enables navigation using named routes throughout the app

### theme.dart

```dart
class AppTheme {
  static const primaryColor = Color(0xFF2196F3);
  static const secondaryColor = Color(0xFF03A9F4);
  static const accentColor = Color(0xFF00BCD4);
  static const backgroundColor = Color(0xFFF5F5F5);
  static const textColor = Color(0xFF212121);
